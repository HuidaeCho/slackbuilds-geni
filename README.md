# Custom SlackBuilds

This repository contains `*.sbopkg` and related files that customize [SBo-git](https://github.com/Ponce/slackbuilds/) builds. It also provides SlackBuild scripts that are not part of the SBo-git repository for third-party packages with suffix `geni` (Geospatial Engineering & Next Intelligence).

To customize an existing SBo-git repository, run `customsbopkg`.
